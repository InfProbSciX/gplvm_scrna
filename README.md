This repository currently hosts code to reproduce some of results from:
> Modelling Technical and Biological Effects in scRNA-seq data with Scalable GPLVMs

This code has been authored by Aditya Ravuri, Emma Dann and Vidhi Lalchand.
* `notebooks/immunity_expt_icml.ipynb` reproduces the main results of the paper corresponding to the Innate Immunity experiment. This notebook is relatively minimal and a state dict for model parameters is provided along with the data [on google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qpzL2vdEtb_oo-78iRmHLiMHbZH2jyl_?usp=sharing) for easy reproduction of the images presented in the paper.
